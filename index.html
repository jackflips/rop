<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >This document describes a new protocol for anonymous communication over mobile
ad hoc networks (MANETs) that I believe to be a significant improvement over
the existing literature, both in terms of degree of anonymity and latency.
<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />Achieving anonymous communication over MANETs presents a significant challenge,
with threats and constraints that differ dramatically from protocols that work over
copper and fiber. Still, it is useful to illustrate Remote Onion Peeling (ROP) in
contrast with systems like Tor, if only because the reader is probably more familiar
with traditional onion routing.

 id="x1-20001"></a>Tor</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >Tor [1] works using layered encryption. When Alice wishes to send a message to Eve,
She first encrypts the message with Devon&#8217;s key, then with the Carlos&#8217;s key, and
finally with Bob&#8217;s key. She then sends the message to Bob, who strips a layer of
encryption and sends it to Carlos. Carlos does the same and sends it to
Devon. When Devon finally receives the message in plaintext, he passes it
along to Eve. If Eve wishes to reply, she replies to Devon, who encrypts her
reply with <span 
class="cmmi-10">K</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">a</span></sub>, <span 
class="cmmi-10">K</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">b</span></sub>, and <span 
class="cmmi-10">K</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub> respectively and sends it back along the circuit.
<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />This works great over the internet but fares poorly over MANETs for the following reasons:

     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2002x1"><span 
class="cmbx-10">GPA. </span>For the global passive adversary, it is easy to track packets from
     source to destination. Tor doesn&#8217;t defend against the GPA because to do
     so would necessitate cover traffic and the designers didn&#8217;t want to make
     the bandwidth tradeoff. Unfortunately, for wireless networks, the global
     passive adversary is local.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2004x2"><span 
class="cmbx-10">March Down. </span>Adversary nodes in a MANET can move as they please,
     and can get on the path of any circuit that they please. Given enough
     time, the physical connection between members of a circuit will break,
     and in order for it to be repaired it will have to go through the adversary
     node. By marching down the physical path of a circuit, nodes can discover
     the identity of onion nodes, and eventually the sender node itself.
     </li>
     <li

     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2008x4"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Latency. </span>A protocol for wireless mesh networks can&#8217;t just pick any nodes

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Previous approaches in anonymous MANETs</h3>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >The papers that advertise anonymity in wireless mesh networks for the most part do
not achieve what they claim. <br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="cmbx-10">ANODR </span><br 
class="newline" />The most heavily cited paper in this area is ANODR [2]. It works by picking a
destination node and broadcasting a message, encrypted with a public key owned by
the destination node. This public key is appended to the message. Each
intermediate node between the source and its destination adds its ID and a
session key to the message, encrypting it with the public key. When the
destination node receives the message, it decrypts the stored sessions keys
and routing IDs, constructs an onion around both and sends them back to
the source node. The anonymous route has been successfully established.
<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />This solution achieves high levels of anonymity against adversarial nodes but has real
problems with sybil attacks (there could be many, many fake nodes in the network,
certainly compromising anonymity) and with node mobility (if an established route is
broken, the sender node will again flood the network searching for the best route, and
every node has to perform public key operations on the flooded packet to see if they
are indeed the recipient. If other route repair schemes are tried, latency quickly
dominates). ANODR&#8217;s descendants (AnonDSR [3], MASK [4], SDAR [5]) are all
subject to the same issues to varying but invariably problematic degrees.
<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="cmbx-10">AOS </span><br 
class="newline" />AOS [6] takes a dramatically different approach that appears at first to be
promising. Nodes are separated into contiguously connected cliques of about 5-10
nodes each. Intra-clique traffic is exchanged continuously - most of it cover
traffic. When Alice in clique 3 has a real message to send to Eve in clique 14,
she creates a message encrypted with the public key of Devon in clique 11,
then Charlie in clique 10, and finally Bob in clique 2. She also constructs an
onion router data structure, where for each onion layer (analogous to one
hop in Tor but consisting of multiple cliques) there are multiple destination
cliques, but only one clique in the layer has the key to strip the next layer off
of the onion router structure. The clique that does strip a layer off of the
router forwards the message and new router to every clique in the next layer.
<br class="newline" />
<br class="newline" />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/uHb5aPJ.png" alt="AOS">
<br class="newline" />As a consequence of all of this, onion decryption can continue past the point at which
the true destination node received the message. This property gives AOS strong
destination anonymity, and the cover traffic gives AOS resistance against the GPA.
However, because cover traffic is intra-clique only and not inter-clique, it is easy to
trace messages back to their source clique, and from there, given enough
messages or infiltration of the clique by adversary nodes, easy to identity the
source node. And even though destination anonymity is good, intersection
attacks can be attempted after observing messages being sent at both ends of
the circuit. An attacker can use end to end correlation to guess that two
cliques are communicating with each other - an attack made easier if the
network has little non-cover traffic. And once an attacker has discovered two
cliques communicating, it is only a matter of deploying some adversary nodes
to determine which members of the cliques are the source and destination
nodes.

<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s clear that the ANODR approach is problematic, as node mobility leads to very
high latency and frequent network flooding. <br 
class="newline" />
<canvas id="canvas" height="500px" width="500px"></canvas>
<h4 id="label">0 circuits broken since you loaded this page.</h4> 
Each circuit break represents a flooding of the network to establish a new circuit [7].
<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />But what about adding proper pairwise cover traffic to something like AOS? It turns
out that this prevents the GPA from tracking messages back to their source, but it
still doesn&#8217;t defend against adversarial nodes positioning themselves on a path and
marching down the circuit to the source. So what if we rotate circuits frequently so
that paths don&#8217;t exist long enough to be traced back? This would solve the problem,
but then we run into the predecessor attack [8], which works as follows:
<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />In order for an attacker to perform end to end correlation on a circuit, they must
control both the first and last nodes on a circuit (it is easy to correlate traffic when
you can observe entry and exit[9]). The odds of this happening are (<span 
class="cmmi-10">c&#x2215;n</span>)<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup>, where c is
the number of compromised nodes in the network and n is the total number of
nodes. When the number of nodes in the network is large, (<span 
class="cmmi-10">c&#x2215;n</span>)<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup> will usually
be small. However, given repeated circuit switching (circuits are rotated
every 10 minutes in Tor to ensure unlinkability) this number will slowly
increase toward 1. To prevents this, Tor selects a node to be a given user&#8217;s
guard node, which is the first node of every circuit they construct. There
is still an n/c chance the the guard node is compromised, but it does not
increase with each new circuit construction. Unfortunately, guard nodes
won?t work over a wireless medium because of the march down problem and
increasing latency as the guard node drifts away from the source in the network.
But what if we could rotate circuits frequently without revealing who the
immediate predecessor node was, and still have a way to return messages to the
sender?

<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >ROP takes ideas from the overlay networks we&#8217;ve discussed so far, as well as from
cryptographic ratchets like OTR [10] and Axolotl [11]. The core idea is to have onion
stripping take place at remote nodes rather than at actual onion nodes.
<br 
class="newline" /><br

class="cmmi-10">&#x2026;</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">K</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">5</span></sub>). These keys are analogous to chain keys in the Axolotl ratchet. For each
turn of the ratchet, the partner nodes will derive a remote node (<span

class="cmmi-10">&#x2026;</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">N</span><sub><span

one message key (<span

class="cmti-10">MK</span><sub><span

class="cmr-7">2</span></sub><sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup>). Each node will then send its message
key(s) to its remote node, encrypted with the public key of the remote node.
<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />Every time we ratchet forward, the keys that the sender shares with each of the
partner nodes (<span

class="cmr-7">5</span></sub>) are hashed and new keys derived. It is important to
remember that the keys possessed by the partner nodes are shared by the sender, so
that the sender knows all of the message keys as well as all of the remote nodes.

 id="x1-60004"></a>Anonymity Analysis</h3>
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >Because no node on the circuit knows the location of the node that just sent it a
message (the nodes on a circuit are likely not contiguously connected and are instead
connected via proxy chains of intermediate nodes), the circuit can be rotated
frequently without becoming vulnerable to the predecessor attack. If a sender is not
able to frequently rotate their anonymity circuit, they must continue to use the same
one for long periods of time, subjecting them to dramatic latency increases as the
onion nodes drift apart. Of course, there is a tradeoff between how widely partner
nodes are allowed to cast their net in selecting remote nodes (the size of the
anonymity set) and the amount of latency that will exist for any any protocol for
MANETs. <br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />ROP appears to be better than existing protocols at overcoming two of the four
issues enumerated above &#8211; march down and latency, but what about dealing with global
passive attacks and sybil attacks? <br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />
<span 
class="cmbx-10">GPA </span>This is much easier dealt with than sybil attacks. Nodes who are contiguously
connected to each other exchange a constant stream of encrypted, constant size cover
traffic. Real traffic is inserted into this stream. The higher the rate of cover traffic,
the higher the bandwidth of the network.
<br 
class="newline" />
<br 
class="newline" />
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Sybil </span>attacks are difficult to defend against in peer to peer networks. The ROP

solution is to use a web of trust with a central node whose identity is secret conducting
social network analysis on the network [12], anonymously broadcasting the
identities of probable sybil nodes. <br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />When node A and node B connect to each other, they do a handshake to verify that
each possesses the private key counterpart to the public key that is on record for
them in the network. If the handshake is successful, the message <span 
class="cmsy-10">{</span>A is connected to
B<span 
class="cmsy-10">}</span>, signed by A is flooded through the network. We exploit the property that even if
node B is attempting to conduct a sybil attack, it cannot display other false
identities to A while they are still connected. If node B were then to attempt to
connect to node C, claiming to be node D, the connection event would be propagated
through the network but then, if A and C were connected, the two could conduct as
RSSI based check to attempt to verify whether or not B and D are the same node.<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />Because identity verifications are only valid while the two nodes are connected, an
attacker is severely limited in the number of false identities they can present, limited
further by the RSSI checking. And because it is difficult for an attacker to establish
false identities, the social network analysis
algorithm run by the central node can be very successful in identifying sybil nodes.

<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >ROP constitutes what I believe to be an improvement in routing protocol for
anonymity in mobile ad hoc networks. In contrast with existing protocols,
ROP offers better anonymity and much better efficiency in the face of node
mobility.

 id="Xnote"></a>To be fair, ANODR is a stateless protocol while ROP is stateful and
   assumes that each node has semi-perfect knowledge of the network. However,
   a stateful version of ANODR, despite being more efficient at route repair,
   would still suffer from the same problems that plague stateless ANODR.
